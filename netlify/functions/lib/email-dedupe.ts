/**
 * Atomic idempotency layer for transactional emails that can be triggered from more
 * than one code path.
 *
 * The purchase confirmation email has three potential firing sites:
 *   1. YooKassa webhook `payment.succeeded` → `tryPurchaseSideEffects`
 *   2. `/api/get-payment-status` polling fallback (frontend success page)
 *   3. Manual `/api/test-email` (dev only)
 *
 * Until now (1) and (2) both checked `webhook_events` for the *event* row before
 * sending, but the check was read-only — concurrent webhook + polling, page reloads
 * after `succeeded`, and webhook retries each opened a new TOCTOU window. The result
 * was up to N duplicate emails per purchase.
 *
 * This module reuses the existing `webhook_events` table (UNIQUE on `provider, event_id`)
 * as a per-order single-shot lock for email delivery. INSERT…ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING
 * RETURNING id is atomic at the row level in PostgreSQL, so only the first concurrent
 * caller observes a non-empty result and is allowed to actually call Resend.
 *
 * If the send subsequently fails we release the reservation so a future retry can
 * acquire it again (matches the existing `releaseWebhookEvent` pattern in the webhook
 * handler).
 */
