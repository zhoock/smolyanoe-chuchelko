          "«Смоляное чучелко» is a Russian musical group from Moscow, playing in the genres of grunge and alternative rock. The group is actively inspired by the aesthetics and sound of Seattle grunge of the 1990s. Their work is distinguished by a dark sound, atmospheric arrangements and deep lyrics touching on themes of internal struggle, self-destruction and melancholy.",
