      "«Смоляное чучелко» is a Russian musical group from Moscow playing grunge and alternative rock. The band draws heavily on the aesthetics and sound of 1990s Seattle grunge, combining dense guitars with introspective lyrics about inner struggle and melancholy.",
      "Vocalist and songwriter Yaroslav Zhuk shapes the project’s philosophy, weaving raw energy with atmospheric soundscapes and cinematic arrangements.",
      "The band has released several albums, including 23 and Smolyanoe Chuchelko, available on streaming platforms. The name “Tar Baby” hints at a problem that becomes more tangled the more you try to solve it."
