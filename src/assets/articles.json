I got out from under his bulk, staggered into the main hall, and while everyone stared at me with bulging eyes as I rasped that the guard should be fired, he burst in, gun in hand, fired, but missed.

I had been working towards this for a long time, but when it finally happened, it almost felt wrong… But in any case, it sounded awesome. It’s not about being the “heaviest” or the “most aggressive” sound you can achieve. It’s more like the sound of a live pig being hung on a hook and slowly cut open.         Technically, a guitar isn’t supposed to make that kind of sound, because it doesn’t really resemble a typical guitar tone. But if someone doesn’t like it, they can always listen to something else. The guitar sound was captured both close to the speaker and from a distance of two meters in the room."

It was the first time any of us had been there, including Ilya, so it was a bit nerve-wracking, but I think we handled it well. We wrapped it up in two sessions. We left all the settings on the console overnight to avoid recalling everything, and in the morning, we finished it up. In my opinion, we kind of messed up the balance on two tracks (pushed the guitar too high), but that’s the risk of analog mixing. We knew what we were getting into. Overall, it turned out pretty good. DIY."

Кроме того, в оригиналах нет тире (-), разделяющего слова FULL и CHORUS. EHX c 79 до начала 80-х использовали чипы: MN3007 либо RETICON SAD1024 (самый редкий и востребованный по причине пользования его \"сами знаете кем\"). Но дело, конечно же, только в том, что переиздание звучит как гавно.",
